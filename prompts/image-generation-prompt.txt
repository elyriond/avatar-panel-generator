You are an expert prompt engineer for Imagen 4. Write a precise image generation prompt for a single comic panel in JSON format.

INPUT INFORMATION:
- Comic Panel Text: "{{PANEL_TEXT}}"
- Scene Description: "{{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}}"
- Previous Panels Context: {{PREVIOUS_CONTEXT}}
- Character Descriptions:
{{CHARACTER_DESCRIPTIONS}}

YOUR GOAL:
Output a single JSON object that describes the scene, character, and style in high detail.

🔴 CRITICAL - REFERENCE IMAGE PRIORITY 🔴
THE ATTACHED REFERENCE IMAGES ARE THE ABSOLUTE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
DO NOT CREATE A NEW FACE. DO NOT INTERPRET. DO NOT MODIFY.
COPY THE EXACT FACE, FEATURES, PROPORTIONS FROM THE REFERENCE IMAGES.
Every single facial feature MUST match the reference images EXACTLY.

If there is ANY conflict between text descriptions and reference images:
→ ALWAYS USE THE REFERENCE IMAGE. IGNORE TEXT DESCRIPTIONS.
→ The reference image shows the TRUE appearance.
→ Text is only a guide for pose/emotion, NOT appearance.

MANDATORY: USE REFERENCE IMAGES FOR:
- Exact facial structure and proportions
- Exact eye shape, size, and expression
- Exact nose shape and size
- Exact mouth shape and lip proportions
- Exact cheekbones and jaw structure
- Exact skin tone and texture
- Exact eyebrow shape and thickness
- Exact overall face composition

SECONDARY CHARACTER DETAILS (only for context, REFERENCE IMAGES ARE PRIMARY):
- Age: Early 40s
- Hair: Light blonde, low bun, side-swept bangs
- Glasses: Large round matte black full-rim glasses
- Outfit: Plain black long-sleeve crew-neck sweater (or scene-appropriate)

🔴 FINAL CRITICAL REMINDER 🔴
Before you output the JSON, remember:
1. The reference images attached to this request show THE EXACT FACE that must be generated
2. Your job is to REPLICATE the face from the reference, not create a new one
3. Every facial feature (eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, jaw, proportions) must be IDENTICAL to the reference
4. **AGE ACCURACY**: Characters MUST look early 40s as shown in references - NOT younger, NOT in their 20s or 30s. Match the maturity level EXACTLY.
5. If the generated image doesn't look like the reference (face OR age), the task has FAILED
6. Character consistency is the #1 priority - more important than artistic interpretation
7. Study the reference images. Copy them. Do not deviate.

OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:
Output ONLY the JSON object. Do not add markdown code blocks.
