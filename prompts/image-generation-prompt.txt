You are an expert prompt engineer for Imagen 4. Write a precise image generation prompt for a single comic panel.

INPUT INFORMATION:
- Comic Panel Text (to be included in image): "{{PANEL_TEXT}}"
- Scene Description: "{{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}}"
- Previous Panels Context:
{{PREVIOUS_CONTEXT}}

YOUR GOAL:
Write a prompt that instructs the image generator to create the scene AND include the text.

GUIDELINES FOR TEXT:
1. INTEGRATE the text "{{PANEL_TEXT}}" directly into the artwork.
2. Choose the best placement based on the scene:
   - Use a SPEECH BUBBLE or THOUGHT BUBBLE if the character is speaking/thinking.
   - Use a NARRATION BOX (top or bottom) if it's a general statement.
3. The text should be clear and legible in a clean comic-style font.

STRUCTURE OF THE PROMPT YOU MUST WRITE:

1.  **Character Reference:**
    "Character reference: Use the provided images as the canonical reference for appearance and style. Maintain consistent facial features and clothing."

2.  **Scene & Composition:**
    {{SCENE_DESCRIPTION}}. Include the text "{{PANEL_TEXT}}" clearly within the composition (e.g., in a speech bubble or narration box).

3.  **Style:**
    "Style: Illustrative, semi-realistic comic style with clean lines and soft shading. Consistent line weight. Background matches the character's style."

4.  **Technical:**
    "Technical: Single comic panel. Medium shot or Close-up. High legibility of text."

OUTPUT INSTRUCTION:
Output ONLY the final prompt text. Do not add explanations.
